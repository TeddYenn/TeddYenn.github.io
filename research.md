</small>

> _ShiNyP_ offers an integrated, user-friendly platform for efficient and reproducible genome-wide SNP analysis, lowering the technical barrier for population genomics research.

- **Why do we need this?** Current SNP analysis pipelines are fragmented and require command-line skills, making them inaccessible to many researchers.
- **How is it done?** _ShiNyP_ integrates all major SNP analysis modules into a single, user-friendly R/Shiny platform, covering the entire workflow with automated visualizations and AI-generated reports.

#### Core Collection Framework for Selection Footprints in Vegetable Soybeans

<small>
<u>Yen-Hsiang Huang</u>, Chung-Feng Kao
</small>

> Our core collection-based pipeline unveils distinctive selection patterns between vegetable and grain soybeans, identifying selection footprints and favorable alleles in vegetable soybeans, and guiding genomic insights for enhanced breeding strategies.

- **Why do we want to know?** Vegetable soybean is an important East Asian crop with distinct traits from grain soybeans, shaped by long-term selection, but the underlying genomic changes are not well understood.
- **What are the results?** The study identified reduced genetic diversity and significant differentiation in vegetable soybeans, revealed key selective regions, and highlighted two candidate genes for targeted breeding.

#### A Multiple Phenotype Imputation for Genetic Diversity and Core Collection

<small>
<u>Yen-Hsiang Huang</u>, Hsin-Mei Ku, Chong-An Wang, Ling-Yu Chen, Shan-Syue He, Shu Chen, Po-Chun Liao, Pin-Yuan Juan, Chung-Feng Kao*
</small>

> Multiple imputation enables efficient and accurate selection of representative core collections in vegetable soybean, overcoming challenges of missing and correlated phenotypic data for plant breeding.

- **Why do we need this?** Accurately selecting core collections for breeding is challenging due to missing and correlated phenotypic data, which limits the efficient use of germplasm resources.
- **What are the results?** By applying multiple imputation, we reliably selected a representative core collection with high morphological diversity, demonstrating improved efficiency and accuracy over traditional methods.

#### Research Review

> Through these projects, I have mastered the ability to manipulate both genotypic and phenotypic data. Building on this foundation, I have actively broadened my research scope and contributed to the research community by developing an easy-to-use analysis platform. I am now continuing to expand my research into new fields.
